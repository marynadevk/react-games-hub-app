# Game Hub

### Project Description

**Game Hub** is a game searching application, built using **Vite**, **React**, and **TypeScript**, styled with **Chakra UI**, and integrated with the **RAWG API** to fetch game data.

The application enables users to explore a vast collection of games, refine their search by selecting specific genres and platforms, organize the results based on different factors, and look up particular games. Additionally, users can access in-depth game details, such as trailers and screenshots. The app also offers both dark and light mode options, enhancing the overall user experience.
